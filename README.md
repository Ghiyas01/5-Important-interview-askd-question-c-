Write 5 most important asked question in c++


//First  Question

1)  What is using namespace std in C++?

Ans.

 Using namespace std in C++ tells the compiler that you will be making use of the namespace called ‘std’. The ‘std’ namespace contains all the features of the standard library. You need to put this statement at the start of all your C++ codes if you don’t want to keep on writing std:: infront of every variable/string or whatever standard library feature you are making use of, as it becomes tedious to do so.


 2) What is type casting in C++?

 Ans. 

 Type casting in C is used to change the data type. They are of two types: Implicit Type Conversion: It is automatic. Explicit Type Conversion: It is user-defined.


 3) What is the difference between structure and class in C++?

 Ans. 

 The difference between structure and class is as follows:

– By default, the data members of the class are private whereas data members of structure are public.

– While implementing inheritance, the access specifier for struct is public whereas for class its private.

– Structures do not have data hiding features whereas class does.

– Structures contain only data members whereas class contains data members as well as member functions.

– In structure, data members are not initialized with a value whereas in class, data members can be initialised.

– Structures are stored as stack in memory whereas class is stored as heap in memory.


4) Which operator cannot be overloaded in C++ ?

Ans. 

Some of the operators that cannot be overloaded are as follows:

– Dot operator- “.”

– Scope resolution operator- “::”

– “sizeof” operator

– Pointer to member operator- “.*”


5) What is the difference between C++ and Java?

Ans. 

This is one of the most common c++ interview questions asked, the difference between c++ and java are as follows:

– C++ supports goto statements whereas Java does not.

– C++ is majorly used in system programming whereas Java is majorly used in application programming.

– C++ supports multiple inheritance whereas Java does not support multiple inheritance

– C++ supports operator overloading whereas Java does not support operator overloading.

– C++ has pointers which can be used in the program whereas Java has pointers but internally.

– C++ uses a compiler only whereas Java uses both compiler and interpreter.

– C++ has both call by value and call by reference whereas Java supports only call by value.

– C++ supports structures and joins whereas Java does not support structure and joins

– Java supports unsigned right shift operator (>>>) whereas C++ does not.

– C++ is interactive with hardware whereas Java is not that interactive with hardware.
